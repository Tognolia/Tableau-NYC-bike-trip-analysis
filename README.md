### Tableau: Visualizing Citibike Trips
Now, we will create a visualization dashboard in Tableau.  We will accomplish this with the help of the following tasks:

- Import and understand the data 
- Measures and dimensions
- Most popular end stations
- Most popular start stations
- Average trip duration
- Data distribution
- Start and stop times
- Visualize and create dashboard
